# Flutter Architecture & Dart Fundamentals

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the core architecture of **Flutter**, Google’s modern framework for building high-performance, cross-platform applications, and the **Dart** programming language that powers it.

By completing this lesson, I gained an understanding of:

Flutter’s layered architecture
The widget tree and widget-based UI system
Reactive rendering using setState()
Essential Dart language features
How Flutter enables seamless Android and iOS development with a single codebase

# 🎯 Objective

To understand Flutter’s architecture, widget-based UI system, and Dart fundamentals for building interactive, reactive, and visually consistent mobile applications.

---

# 🏗️ 1. Flutter Architecture

Flutter is built using three core layers:

## 1️⃣ Framework Layer (Dart)

Written in **Dart**
Includes:
  - Material & Cupertino widgets
  - Rendering libraries
  - Animation system
  - Gesture handling

This is where developers write application UI and logic.

---

## 2️⃣ Engine Layer (C++)

Built using **C++**
Uses the **Skia graphics engine**
Handles:
  - Rendering
  - Text layout
  - Platform channels

Flutter renders everything itself instead of relying on native UI components.

-----

## 3️⃣ Embedder Layer

Connects Flutter to platform-specific APIs:
  - Android
  - iOS
  - Web
  - Desktop

It integrates Flutter with the host operating system.

---

## 🔑 Key Concept

Flutter does **not** use native UI components.

Instead, it renders every pixel using the **Skia engine**, which ensures:

Pixel-perfect UI consistency
Smooth animations
Identical design across platforms
High performance

---

# 🌳 2. Understanding the Widget Tree

In Flutter, **everything is a widget**.

Examples:
Text
Buttons
Layout containers
Entire screens

Widgets are organized in a hierarchical structure called the **Widget Tree**.

Example structure:


Each widget is nested inside another widget, forming a parent-child relationship.

## 🔄 Types of Widgets

### 🟢 StatelessWidget

Used for static UI
Does not change after being built
No mutable state

Example:

dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text("Hello Flutter");
  }
}
